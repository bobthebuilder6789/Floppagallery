    <h1>Welcome to Floppa Gallery!</h1>
    <p>Floppa Gallery was created by Hayden, Ephrem, and Franklin (but Franklin didnt do anything). Most of the work was done by good ol' me, Hayden. The time is currently exactly 6:00pm(7:10pm at time of finishing everything) and I starting completely renovating this at 3:12pm (when i got home). This means that I have been working on Floppa Gallery like homework for the past 3 hours! I am very sad. Now all i have to do is the credits page.</p>
